                <p style="color: rgb(13, 42, 102) ">Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. 
                    It evokes the royal family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now 
                    called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color.
                     At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded 
                     City Palace complex. With gardens, courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence.

                <p style="color:red">Air travel is the most convenient way to reach the pink city. 
                    The Sanganer airport is well connected to the major cities of India as well as the globe through a number 
                    of airlines operating on a regular basis. Flights to international cities like Kuala Lumpur,
                     Sharjah and Dubai are also easily available. 
                    Buses, taxis and cabs are easily available from the airport to reach the main city.</p>

                    Jaipur and other cities within the state of Rajasthan. There is a regular service from cities
                     like New Delhi, Kota, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Udaipur, Vadodara, and Ajmer at reasonable fares.</p>

                <p style="color:red">The Indian Railways offers a number of express trains to reach Jaipur from other parts of India.
                    Trains like the Shatabdi Express connects Jaipur to almost all major cities of India.
                     An additional attraction is "The Palace on Wheels" which offers a royal ride to Jaipur.
                     A train journey through the desert is an enthralling experience in itself.</p>

                <p style="color:red">Autos are the most viable mode of transport except for when it gets too hot.
                     Cabs also are very easily available. The city bus, 
                     a new addition for the tourists is a hop-on-hop-off service which is quite efficient.
                      Though normal bus service is also available, we wouldn't recommend it for the tourists.
                    Also, the Jaipur metro has made commuting efficient than ever. </p>

                        Founded by Maharana Udai Singh II in 1559, it’s set around a series of artificial lakes and is known 
                        for its lavish royal residences. City Palace, overlooking Lake Pichola, is a monumental complex of 11 palaces, 
                        courtyards and gardens, famed for its intricate peacock mosaics.</p>

                        Mumbai and Jaipur have flights scheduled every day from here, which makes the travel quite convenient.</p>

                      <p style="color:red">The city lies midway between Delhi and Mumbai, at the intersection of NH 8, 
                        Golden quadrilateral, East west Corridor and NH 76. Road travellers can drive down to the city
                         either from Ahmedabad through NH8 which takes approximately 5 hours or from Jaipur which is a 
                         6-hour journey via the Golden quadrilateral. 
                        It's also a 4-hour drive from Kota through the EW corridor.</p>

                            Behind its massive walls stand the ornate Maharaja's Palace and intricately carved Jain temples.

                            One can take connecting flights to this place from the other cities. 
                            It is advisable to take a cab from the Jodhpur airport to Jaisalmer. 
                            The picturesque view will make the 4-5 hours journey worthwhile.</p>

                             Buses are also easily available since it is such a popular destination among tourist.</p>

                        <p style="color:red">Jaisalmer is really well connected in terms of the railway network.
                             Especially with cities like Delhi, Jaipur and Jodhpur, with major trains like “Delhi Jaisalmer Express”,
                              “Jodhpur Jaisalmer Express”, and “Howrah Jaisalmer Express”. 
                              Rickshaws and autos are easily available outside the railway station. 
                            It usually takes about INR 40-50 for an auto ride to the centre of the city from the railway station.</p>
                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center;"><b>Local Transport</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">Autos and tongas are the most widely used mode of transport within the city. Bargaining is the key to tackle the auto-rickshaw drivers. Autos only ply between 8 AM to 8 PM to go inside the fort area.
                              
                            Rickshaw pullers might not be as friendly as you would expect them to be, but it's the best way to beat the bottlenecks in the city. Bikes are available for rent too.
                            <br>
                            Bicycles, however, are much more recommended as they can be manoeuvred easily in congested areas (the fares of the bicycle being borrowed varies according to the model one borrows).
                            <br>
                            Hiring cabs for the entire day can be an expensive affair. But if you are willing to make this investment, 
                            a cab for four people can cost around INR 3000 for the entire day. 
                            If you are looking forward to booking a bike, the starting price is usually INR 1000 per day.

                            and some other cities in Gujarat/Rajasthan. Flights could be a little expensive as
                             there are just a few flights to here, but if you book in advance you should be able to get a good price.</p>
                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center"><b>Road</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">Jodhpur has great road connectivity from other parts of the state. 
                            You can book sleeper bus tickets from Delhi or Ahmedabad - these typically have an overnight schedule and 
                            drop you in Jodhpur early morning. They are quite cheap and comfortable,
                             and a good way to reach Jodhpur if you're not able to get train tickets but want to do a budget trip.</p> 
                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center"><b>Train</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">Jodhpur railway station has good train connectivity 
                            with almost all the major cities in Rajasthan, and from Delhi/Mumbai/Ahmedabad and even Kolkata.
                             From Delhi, taking a train is a very convenient option since you can take an overnight train to reach Jodhpur
                              early morning. It takes a little long (around 16-18 hours) to reach from Mumbai. 
                              Jodhpur is well connected to Jaipur/Udaipur by train, so if you are planning a whole Rajasthan trip, 
                            traveling by train within Rajasthan is a good and cheap option.</p>
                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center"><b>Local Transport</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">Being a tourist attraction, commuting within the city is not an issue.
                             Both Olacabs and Uber are available in Jodhpur at very reasonable rates, 
                             so you can use the app to conveniently hop from one location to another.
                              However, these cabs don't enter a part of city which has narrow alleys. 
                              So it is better to ask the driver before boarding!
                            Local autos are available as well - you'll need to bargain with them a little but 
                            they generally don't charge exorbitant prices. You can also talk to the auto drivers 
                            to stay with you the whole day - that's another convenient option.

                                It is named after the historic Ranthambore Fort, which lies within the park.
