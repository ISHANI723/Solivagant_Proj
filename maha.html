                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center;"><b>Road</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">Mumbai has road links to all parts of the country with the Mumbai-Pune Expressway 
                           being the most popular of the lot. The road conditions are better than the rest of the country. 
                           Mumbai is also well served by buses from all the major destinations. The Asiad Bus Service is a bus terminal located
                            on the Dadar road from where buses travel to Pune regularly. 
                           The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation operate services in Mumbai from various cities in Maharashtra.</p> 
                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center;"><b>Train</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">The nearest railway station is Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus Railway Station, 
                           also the second largest railway station in the world. 12.3 km away from the Mumbai city, via Western Highway, 
                           this station is well connected to the rest of India. There are many more stations, viz. Mumbai Central and 
                           Lokmanya Tilak Terminal that serve the city of Mumbai. Alternatively, when in Mumbai, 
                           the local train service is arguably the most affordable option for an intra-Mumbai visit.</p>
                        <h3 style="color: rgb(34, 46, 211);text-align: center;"><b>Local Transport</b></h3>
                        <p style="color:red">Public transport is very accessible, as well as affordable in Mumbai.
                            Unlike most other parts of India, the auto rickshaws travel by meter and don't fuss about the destination.
                             The base fare is Rs. 18 for the first 1.5 km, and then Rs. 12. 19 per km.
                              
                           However, the traffic conditions in Mumbai are terrible, making local trains the best option to reach somewhere on time.
