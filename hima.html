                        <p style="color:red">The Shimla Airport, also known as Jubbarhatti airport is around 25 km away from the main 
                            city and is one of the very few airports at any of the hill stations. Probably one of the smallest airstrips, 
                            the ride is pretty bumpy in the plane when it lands. However, since this airport is not functional throughout 
                            the year, hence it's advisable to choose Chandigarh or Delhi as connecting airports.
                             People coming by air till Chandigarh generally prefer to book cabs to reach Shimla, which will take 3-4 hours.
                              There are regular buses too. 
                            From Delhi airport, it roughly takes around 7-8 hours to reach Shimla.</p>

It takes around 5-6 hours from Kalka to reach here by train, but it's a very beautiful journey with a lot of tunnels and scenery which makes up for the extra time taken on the route.
                           There are around 3-4 trains everyday from Kalka to Shimla. You can also travel by Rail car which is one of its kind in India).Chandigarh Railway station is also just 113 km away from Shimla. 
                            From both of these railway stations, Shimla is well connected with local buses and cabs. Shimla has its own railway station, but only narrow gauge trains from Kalka arrive here.

                            Private taxis are easily available and economically viable. Local sightseeing charges vary from 800 INR to 1500 INR per day. Auto rickshaws are not very popular in Himachal Pradesh.
